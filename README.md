# TouringMachine
An ISA + Assembler + Emulator that I first wrote while bored in math class one afternoon. Originally supposed to be a Turing Machine emulator, the project grew a little bit from there.

I'm probably not ever going to touch this again, but it was pretty nifty to use what I learned to make something like this. Figuring out how to add two numbers while only having one register and increment instructions was a fun little challenge as well!
